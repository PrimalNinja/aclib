# ACLIB - Adventure Creator Library

ACLIB is a library for JavaScript to aid in the creation of text adventures.  A simple text adventure is provided to document the structure by example.

Although the adventure structure can be coded by hand, it also is quite relevant to use a code generator from a database or adventure creator to generate it. The actual adventure creator play engine is not yet complete which requires a command line to type in and some text language parsing - as simple or complicated as you might like.
